# Collections
# The collections module in Python implements specialized container datatypes,
# providing alternatives to Pythonâ€™s general purpose built-in containers, dict, list, set, and tuple.



# The following tools exist:

# namedtuple : factory function for creating tuple subclasses with named fields
# OrderedDict : dict subclass that remembers the order entries were added
# Counter : dict subclass for counting hashable objects
# defaultdict : dict subclass that calls a factory function to supply missing values
# deque : list-like container with fast appends and pops on either end
# In Python 3 some more modules exist (ChainMap, UserDict, UserList, UserString).
# See https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html for further references.



# from collections import Counter
# a = "aaaaabbbbccc"
# my_counter = Counter(a)
# print(my_counter.values())
