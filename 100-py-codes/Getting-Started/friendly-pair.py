# # Friendly Pair Numbers
# # The numbers whose ( sum of divisors ) / number ratio is same are known as Friendly Pair Numbers.
# # Let's try and understand it better using an example

# # Example
# # Input : 6  28
# # Output : Yes, they are a friendly pair

# # Explanation : The factors of 6 and 28 except the numbers themselves are 1, 2, 3 and 1, 2, 4, 7, 14 respectively.
# # Now the sum of factors of both the numbers are 6 and 28 respectively. 
# # When we divide the sums with the numbers we get 1 and 1 respectively. 
# # As the ratio of both the number match, they are considered as a friendly pair.
